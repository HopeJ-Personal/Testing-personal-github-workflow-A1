# Testing-personal-github-workflow-A1
Github repository for testing and attempting to create a github workflow so to speak to go along with my programming projects. One that allows me to easily upload progress to github, and should it be needed, build any "artifacts" or generate any necessary stuff or at least make changes visible on the repo without me manually copy and pasting it. :/
